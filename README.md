## ðŸ›  **How It Works**

### **HTML Structure**
The `index.html` file defines the structure of the form and the display section. Key components include:
- Input fields for **name**, **course**, **email**, and **image upload**.
- Checkboxes for **gender** and **skills** selection.
- A **submit button** to process the form data.

```html
<form action="" id="form">
    <div class="f1">
        <label for="name">Name*:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" class="in" placeholder="Enter name" required>
    </div>
    <div class="f2">
        <label for="gender">Gender:</label>
        <div class="c">
            <div class="c1"><input type="checkbox" name="gender">
                <label for="">Male</label>
            </div>
            <div class="c1"><input type="checkbox" name="gender">
                <label for="">Female</label>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Additional fields for course, email, skills, and image upload -->
</form>
```

### **JavaScript Functionality**
The `script.js` file handles form submission and dynamically displays the entered data:
- Prevents the default form submission behavior.
- Captures input values and creates new DOM elements to display the data.
- Handles image uploads and displays the uploaded image.

```javascript
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    data();
    form.reset();
});
```

### **CSS Styling**
The `style.css` file provides the visual styling for the form and the displayed data:
- Modern and clean design with a dark theme.
- Responsive layout adjustments for smaller screens.

```css
.container {
    background-color: #1f1f1f;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px black;
    padding: 20px;
}
```
